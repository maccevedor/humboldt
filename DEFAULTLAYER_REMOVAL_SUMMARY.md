   - Removed related_name='default_layers' from Project model

2. **applications/projects/admin.py**
   - Removed `DefaultLayer` from imports
   - Removed `DefaultLayerAdmin` class (lines 222-242)
   - Removed admin registration for DefaultLayer

3. **applications/projects/serializers.py**
   - Removed `DefaultLayer` from imports

### ⚠️ Requires Manual Action

6. **applications/projects/migrations/0001_initial.py**
   - **Status**: File owned by root, requires sudo to modify
   - **Action needed**: Run `./fix_migration_defaultlayer.sh` or manually execute:
     ```bash
     sudo sed -i '77,92d' visor-geografico-I2D-backend/applications/projects/migrations/0001_initial.py
     ```
   - **What it removes**: CreateModel operation for DefaultLayer table

## What Was DefaultLayer?

The `DefaultLayer` model was designed to specify which layers should be initially visible when entering a project. However, this functionality was:
- Not being used in the current implementation
- Redundant with the `estado_inicial` field in the `Layer` model
- Adding unnecessary complexity to the admin interface

## Next Steps

1. **Fix Migration File** (if not done yet):
   ```bash
   ./fix_migration_defaultlayer.sh
   ```

2. **Review Changes**:
   ```bash
   cd visor-geografico-I2D-backend && git diff
   ```

3. **Test Backend**:
   ```bash
   docker-compose restart backend
   ```

4. **Drop Database Table** (if it exists in production):
   If the `default_layers` table exists in your database, create a migration to drop it:
   ```bash
   docker-compose exec backend python manage.py makemigrations --name remove_default_layer_table
   ```
   
   Or manually add this migration:
   ```python
   from django.db import migrations

   class Migration(migrations.Migration):
       dependencies = [
           ('projects', '0002_layergroup_color'),
       ]

       operations = [
           migrations.RunSQL(
               sql='DROP TABLE IF EXISTS default_layers CASCADE;',
               reverse_sql='-- No reverse operation'
           ),
       ]
   ```

5. **Commit Changes**:
   ```bash
   cd visor-geografico-I2D-backend
   git add -A
   git commit -m "Remove unused DefaultLayer model and all references"
   ```

## Verification

To verify all DefaultLayer references are removed:
```bash
grep -r "DefaultLayer" visor-geografico-I2D-backend/ --include="*.py" | grep -v ".backup"
```

Expected output: Only the migration file (if not yet fixed)

## Backup Files

Backup files were created with `.backup` extension:
- `models.py.backup`
- `admin.py.backup`
- `serializers.py.backup`
- `views.py.backup`
- `populate_projects.py.backup`

These can be safely deleted after verifying the changes work correctly.

## Impact Assessment

### ✅ No Breaking Changes Expected
- DefaultLayer was not used in the frontend
- No API endpoints were actively using the default_layers relationship
- The `estado_inicial` field in Layer model provides the same functionality

### ✅ Benefits
- Cleaner codebase
- Reduced complexity in admin interface
- Fewer database tables to maintain
- Simplified project configuration
